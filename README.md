# Hi! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Nice to Meet You!

My name is David Angeles Albores (for science purposes, David Angeles-Albores), a computational biologist with expertise in ML/AI and anything genomics. I'm a Python lover, will program in R if you want me to, and my nightmares are haunted by my time in undergrad spent learning MatLab (_shudder_). Big fan of open-source code, documentation and fun projects. I like to play in teams. Mexican native, photography lover, and #teamwilpers Peloton fan.

## More about me:
- 💜 Kind people are my people
- 💻👨‍🔬 Computational biology is awesome
- ✨ Love learning
- 🏋️ 🧗🚴🏊 Weight-lifter, amateur climber, cyclist, and swimmer
- 🏃 Ha, just kidding. I do not run. At all. If a bear was chasing us, you would most likely survive.
- 🦭 My spirit animal is the seal. Floppy on land, powerful in the sea... and probably would get eaten by an orca 🤔
